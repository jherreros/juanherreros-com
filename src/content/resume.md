Platform Engineering Leader with a strong background in building Internal Developer Platforms, Cloud Infrastructure, and DevOps practices.

I specialize in creating self-service, secure, and scalable platforms that empower product teams to ship faster and more reliably. With a blend of technical depth and product thinking, I lead teams, shape platform strategy, and drive adoption across organizations.

Passionate about developer experience, team health, and delivering real impact through well-designed internal products.

# Work Experience

## Banking Circle (2021 - Present)

### Platform Engineering Manager
*April 2025 - Present*

I lead the team behind three of Banking Circle's core "Atlas" platforms.

Atlas is the foundation our engineering teams build on. It gives developers a powerful, intuitive, self-service experience to manage everything they need—quickly and reliably.

- **Atlas Compute**: Our Kubernetes-based platform where applications run. It includes additional capabilities for deployment, security, networking, and observability. 
- **Atlas Messaging**: Built on Azure Service Bus and Event Hub, it enables seamless communication between our services. 
- **Atlas Infra**: Built on Azure and following the Landing Zone paradigm, it provides the supporting infrastructure developers need—mainly for configuration and state management.

### Principal Platform Engineer
*October 2024 - April 2025*

- Design and implementation of our compute, messaging (Pub/Sub) and infrastructure platforms
- Product management of those platforms: handling backlog, gathering user feedback, internal communication, driving adoption
- Recruiting and mentorship of other team members
- Establishing best practices on how to use all our platforms

### Tech Lead
*December 2022 - April 2025*

We built a new team and started building a platform on top of Kubernetes. There, my responsibilities ranged from designing the architecture and functionality of the platform, to implementing it, to getting developers in Banking Circle to use it; while ensuring everyone in the team is feeling well, learning and able to deliver on our vision.

This Kubernetes platform includes a series of CNCF-hosted, other open-source and also proprietary software. Among others, we use ArgoCD, Cilium, Grafana, Kyverno or Trivy. We not only put pieces together, but build a cohesive, intuitive interface on top, to ensure people can use it efficiently and in a self-service fashion, without having to understand the underlying complexity; as well as to ensure everything we do on it is secure and compliant.

### Senior DevOps Engineer
*March 2022 - December 2022*

I created a series of reusable building blocks (Terraform Modules, pipeline templates) and I facilitated their usage throughout the organization.

Some teams that already had some familiarity with Azure Pipelines or Terraform were able to consume the "blocks" in a self-service way, but I was also involved in helping other teams adopt these solutions.

### DevOps Engineer
*March 2021 - March 2022*

I first joined the team building our client-facing API, as the DevOps Engineer in a team otherwise composed of developers and testers. I had 2 main responsibilities and in both cases, I took a modular approach, creating reusable building blocks.

- Coding a declarative definition (Infrastructure as Code - Terraform) of all the resources the team was using in Azure.
- Taking care of standardizing the app delivery process (or SDLC) for all our microservices, through pipeline templates (Azure DevOps).

## Saxo Bank (2018-2021)

### DevOps Engineer
*December 2019 - February 2021*

Worked in the Data in Motion team as a DevOps Engineer, working with Kafka, Azure, Azure DevOps, Ansible, Git or Grafana; making our developments faster and our infrastructure more reliable.

### IT Graduate
*September 2018 - December 2019*

I joined Saxo's Graduate program, where I spent some months working in each of these teams: Data Science, Data Engineering and finally the Data in Motion team (Kafka), in which I worked as a DevOps Engineer.
